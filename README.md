1) Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a company that specializes in financial consulting. They are looking to update their system to be up to industry standards in security practices. 
2) What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a          companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
  I implemented a checksum file verification to ensure file integrity
3) What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  One of the more challenging parts of working through the vulnerabliltiy assessment was figuring out how to supress false positives in order to see the vulnerablilities that       applied to the code that I was working with. 
4) How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation          techniques?
  I approached the need to increase layers of security by refactoring code to incorporate http and constantly analyzed the code for bugs and potential security risks and bugs. I     would use these same strategies in the future. 
5) How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I ran the static test to look for vulnerabilites, I analyzed the code for vulnerabilities while I was coding, and I checked that the code compiled properly. 
6) What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Maven was a helpful tool that I would like to use in the future now that I have experience with it. 
7) Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment      might you want to showcase to a future employer?
  I would want to showcase my ability to analyze a project for potential security vulnerabilities and properly implament fixes for them.
